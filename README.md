ShadowSweep – Android Threat Analysis Tool

ShadowSweep is a Python-based forensic tool for Android threat detection and analysis.
It was developed as part of an internship project at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW).

The tool detects hidden apps, malware, and suspicious behavior by analyzing Android device logs.
It also integrates OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques such as WHOIS, IP lookups, and dark web scanning (via Tor), presented through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

# 🚀 Features

Log Analysis – Extracts and analyzes Android logs using ADB.

OSINT Integration – WHOIS, IP lookups, and dark web scanning via Tor.

Interactive Dashboard – Streamlit-based UI for easy navigation.

Exportable Reports – Generate CSV reports for documentation.

Network-level Analysis – Supports extended forensic investigation.
